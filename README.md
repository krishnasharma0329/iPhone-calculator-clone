# iPhone-calculator-clone
Thrilled to share a project I worked on during my internship: a functional iPhone calculator clone! This project helped me solidify my understanding of , HTML, CSS, JavaScript.  I enjoyed the challenge of replicating the familiar design and functionality of the iPhone calculator while using web development tools.
